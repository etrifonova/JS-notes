Scratch - a web-based downloadable programming environment with puzzle pieces. 

Sprites are the images on a Scratch computer program screen. Every Scratch program is made up of sprites and the scripts (instructions) that control them. Scripts are programmed to make the sprites do things.

Scratch is like a coordinate system for positioning things on the screen

Scratch is a graphical language that categorizes things by the type of things these pieces do. In the Scratch palette you can functions, variables, boolean expressions, conditionals.

E.g. moving 10 steps or turning one way or the other would be functions (motion). Orients (?): motion, looks, sounds, events, control, etc.

input (hello, world!) -> algorithm (function: say) -> output (cat with speech bubble "hello, world!")
