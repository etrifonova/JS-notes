      <h1>Present Tenses</h1>
      <p>
        I am an English teacher and work with adults. My classes take place online, and I use various technologies such as Google Meet, Miro Board and others. Most of my students are pretty high level, which is why I am often asked about the nuances of the English language. It sometimes turns out that detailed information about such nuances cannot be found quickly, and I have to do deeper research into them.

<p>In addition to my teaching job, I am currently studying web development, which I find/am finding really challenging and exciting. I have done various web dev courses since last year and, by now, I have learned/learnt about the following: HTML5, CSS5, JavaScript, Git, VSCode, and React. As for the latter, I have just started getting to know it by means of building a website for myself. I can’t say that I have solid knowledge of this stack, but I know enough to be able to build small-scale projects. </p>

<p>Modern technology is constantly changing, and sometimes when I am coding or preparing for lessons, I discover that some features have been modified or become deprecated.</p>

<p>I  have been abroad a few times. I have visited the United States, the Czech Republic and Spain. In addition to English, I also (14) speak Spanish and German. Unfortunately, I haven’t been to Germany yet, but I would like to do that someday.</p>
