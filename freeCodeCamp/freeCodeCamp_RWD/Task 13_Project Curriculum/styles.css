Step 26
To start your CSS, normalize the CSS rules by targeting all elements with *, including the ::before and ::after pseudo-selectors. Set the padding property and margin property both to 0.
*, ::before, ::after {
  padding: 0;
  margin: 0;
}
 */

 /* 
 Step 44
Create an img selector and give it a width property set to 100%, and an object-fit property set to cover.

The object-fit property tells the browser how to position the element within its container. In this case, cover will set the image to fill the container, cropping as needed to avoid changing the aspect ratio.

 Step 52
If you wanted to add more social icons, but keep them on the same row, you would need to update grid-template-columns to create additional columns. As an alternative, you can use the grid-auto-flow property.

This property takes either row or column as the first value, with an optional second value of dense. grid-auto-flow uses an auto-placement algorithm to adjust the grid layout. Setting it to column will tell the algorithm to create new columns for content as needed. The dense value allows the algorithm to backtrack and fill holes in the grid with smaller items, which can result in items appearing out of order.

For your .social-icons selector, set the grid-auto-flow property to column.

.social-icons {
  display: grid;
  font-size: 3rem;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(5, 1fr);
  grid-auto-flow: column;
}
*/

/* 
Step 75
The place-items property can be used to set the align-items and justify-items values at the same time. The place-items property takes one or two values. If one value is provided, it is used for both the align-items and justify-items properties. If two values are provided, the first value is used for the align-items property and the second value is used for the justify-items property.

Give the .image-wrapper selector a place-items property set to center.
